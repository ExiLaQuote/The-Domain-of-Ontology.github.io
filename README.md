### Things to know:

```
This is my first webpage, written from scratch using HTML and CSS (and DOM manipulators)

Don't forget to look closely. You might miss out on a special feature. . .
```
```
Click on the "index.html", "conquer.html", and "style.css" files to see the code!
```
```
The website is an experiment. It's just meant to be "cool" and test out features. That's all hehe.
