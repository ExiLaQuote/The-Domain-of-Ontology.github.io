			cannot be seen, that which can never be painted or drawn?<br /><br />
			How then must we identify everything there is? Can such things be

					Aristotle first described ontology when he called it "first
					philosophy" in <i>Metaphysics</i> Book IV.

					It became <i>ontologia</i> or "science of being." The field would then
					be developed by Wolff, Husserl, and Quine.

					And that's the limit of my google search abilities. No, I'm not going

					Perhaps such questions are not even real things, so we must not think
